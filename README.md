# A-ROBOTIC-ARM-SOLUTION-FOR-SMARTER-WASTE-MANAGEMENT
A Robotic Arm Solution for Smarter Waste Management uses a YOLOv8n deep learning model on Raspberry Pi to identify waste in real time and an Arduino‑controlled 6‑DOF robotic arm to automatically segregate metal, glass, and paper, improving efficiency, safety, and recycling accuracy.
